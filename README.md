## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Language / Requirements
I decided to use Kotlin and gradle for AOC, as this year I've been pretty into Kotlin. 
This is built using kotlin 1.6.0 and gradle 7.3, so make sure you're using the latest of everything if you pull this project down.

- Kotlin 1.6.0
- [https://gradle.org/](Gradle)


## Usage:

Running the application is simple. First run a gradle build to import all of the required dependecies. Once the gradle import is complete, go ahead and do a gradle build, and then you should be good to run ```Application.kt``` inside of ```com.tyler.puzzle```
